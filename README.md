The Terrors of Nowhere sign for for VRChat avatars

Requirements:
* VRCFury
* ToN Save manager needs to be running and OSC to be turned on in the settings.
* Turn OSC on in your avatar radial menu

Install:
Drag the 'ToN Classic or Special' prefab on to the root of your avatar

To turn it on, go to the 'ToN Classic or Special' menu
* Choose Public to show the sign to everyone
* Choose Local so only you can see the sign

The sign will be blank until it has enough data to predict the next round

How it works:
This follows the rules that:
* A Special will always follow two Classic rounds
* There is a 50% chance of a special after one Classic round
* A Classic will always follow a Special
* There is always a special after the host leaves
* It will alert you to get your items after 8 Pages and Punished rounds

It will not track:
* Moons

Enjoy your time in Terrors of Nowhere.
